# 🧮 Java Calculator Application

- This is a simple **Calculator Application** built using **Java**.  
- It provides basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- The project is designed to demonstrate **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts in Java.

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Calculator.java` → Contains the logic for arithmetic operations.
- `App.java` → Main driver class that interacts with the user and runs the calculator.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
- User-friendly console-based interface
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Well-structured, modular OOP design

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java SE** (Core Java)
- **OOP Principles** (Encapsulation, Classes & Objects)

---
